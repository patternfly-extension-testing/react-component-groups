import NotAuthorized from "@patternfly/react-component-groups/dist/dynamic/NotAuthorized";

A **not authorized** component displays an error screen to users when they attempt to view a page that they don't have permission to access.

## Examples

### Basic not authorized

A basic not authorized component displays a title, a description, and custom actions. 

You can customize the not authorized component to fit your use case by specifying the `serviceName` to appear in the title, the `description` to provide appropriate context for the error, and the `actions` that a user can take instead.

```js file="./NotAuthorizedExample.tsx"

```
